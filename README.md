# The dictation index

[link](https://dictation-toolbox.github.io/dictation-toolbox.org/)

This site is intended as a more visible and complete replacement for caster's (impressively thorough) [voice index](https://github.com/dictation-toolbox/caster/blob/develop/castervoice/doc/readthedocs/Voice_Index.md). The aim is to serve as a useful first point of contact for anybody interested in non-traditional ways of controlling their computer. Content should be thorough and fair, but does not have to feign neutrality.

## Aims
* Provide guidance for users of dictation software, particularly new ones.
* Aggregate disparate resources into one place.
* Get as many expert users as possible to contribute their accumulated wisdom.

## Types of content
* Overviews of a general topic (voice coding, mouse alternatives, dictation etc)
* Pages giving details/reviews of specific tools/products.
* Lists of links to potentially useful or interesting stuff.

## How to contribute
The site is currently hosted on GitHub pages and generated by Jekyll, which turns markdown into HTML.

To add new content or edit existing content, just clone the repository and make a pull request. If you add any new pages, these will have to be registered in `_data/navlist.yml` in order to show up on the sidebar. 

## Plans
* ~~Decide on a title and register a domain name.~~
* Expand content.
* ~~Transfer ownership to dictation-toolbox~~
